# Test conceptualization

## Introduction

In this class, we explore the importance of incorporating testing into the development process. We discussed the benefits of a robust testing culture and the tools available to help us.

## Motivation

- Errors during program execution can interrupt critical flows, affecting users and operations.
- Preventing runtime errors, especially in production systems, is crucial for reliability.

## Why Do Errors Happen?

- Errors are inherent to human development. They may result from misunderstandings, incomplete specifications, or failures in implementation.
- The key to mitigating errors is recognizing our propensity to fail and adopting strategies to minimize them.

## Role of Tests

- Testing helps identify and fix errors before they reach production environments.
- Although not infallible, structured and systematic tests are essential to improve the quality and reliability of software.

## Benefits of Testing

- Increase productivity and confidence in development.
- Contribute to a more collaborative and less stressful work environment.

## Testing Pyramid

- **Unit Tests**: Base of the pyramid; focus on individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: In the middle; evaluate the interaction between components.
- **End-to-End Tests (E2E)**: At the top; check the complete flow of the application.

## Unitary tests

- Analyze isolated functions or methods.
- They are crucial to ensuring that project specifications are met.

## Integration Tests

- Evaluate the interaction between different parts of the project.
- They are important to ensure that external interfaces and dependencies work as expected.

## End-to-End Tests

- Verify the complete behavior of the application.
- They are more complex and costly, but fundamental to the user experience.

## Course Approach

- Focus on unit and integration testing.
- Supplementary materials will cover End-to-End testing.

## Conclusion

Properly structuring tests, from unit tests to End-to-End, is essential to develop robust, reliable and easy-to-maintain applications.
