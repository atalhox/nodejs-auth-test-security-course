# Developing a Testing Culture

##Introduction

A "testing culture" is essential to maximizing the benefits of implementing testing during development. This culture involves creating an environment where the team understands and manages tests effectively, positively impacting code quality and problem resolution.

## Pillars of Testing Culture

To adopt an effective testing culture, we consider three fundamental factors:

### 1. Quality

- Definition of evaluations to evaluate the code.
- Establishing quality objectives and monitoring progress towards these objectives.

### 2. Trust

- Quality-focused development to increase confidence in the code base.
- Continuous improvement to reduce costs and maintain operational efficiency.

### 3. Time

- Time optimization through bug prevention and resolution, and code refactoring.
- Investment in testing to save future time, facilitating the addition of new features.

## Testing Culture Implementation Process

To achieve the fundamental factors, the process is divided into steps:

1. **Requirements Analysis**

   - Identification of functionalities and selection of test types.

2. **Test Plan**

   - Preparation by QA or quality analysts, defining tools, responsibilities, time, complexity and resources.

3. **Test Case**

   - Details of the tests, including conditions, input/output data, and expected behaviors.

4. **Test Environment**

   - Definition of where and how tests will be performed, including pipeline, versioning tools and validation procedures.

5. **Implementation**
   - Documentation of results, problems encountered and possible improvements for future cycles.

## Communication and Documentation

- Effective communication between QA, developers, and managers is crucial.
- Documentation and reports for each phase are essential for discussing improvements and reducing failures.

## Static Tests

- Complementary approach, varying depending on the tool, programming language and execution environment.
